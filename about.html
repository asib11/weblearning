    <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence"><abbr
            title="Artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> is
        intelligence demonstrated by machines, as opposed to the natural intelligence displayed by humans or animals.
        Leading AI textbooks define the field as the study of "intelligent agents: any system that perceives its
        environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of achieving its goals.<sup>[a]</sup> Some popular
        accounts use the
        term "artificial intelligence" to describe machines that mimic "cognitive" functions that humans associate with
        the human mind, such as "learning" and "problem solving", however this definition is rejected by major AI
        researchers.<sup>[b][c]</sup> "</blockquote>
